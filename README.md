# Dummy Event Generation Script
This is a simple python script designed to generate events based on a formatted csv file with dummy data. Dummy data is outputed or formatted JSON
## How to Run
Within the root folder run --
`$ python3 event_generator.py` 
and follow the promts to provide the needed files and dir locations

## Requirements
2 csv files:
1) Events File - This contains all the events and possible event properites that will be used for data generation
2) Flows File - "Flows" referers to the "flows" or "path" that events will occur. This gives structure to the order in which events will be performed and is fundemental to creating trends and behaviors in the data

example template for both of thes files can be found here - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b0LrIq6rxfB5uJaZGDOg9VxvtkabRAym2mgwMC9T0ME/edit?usp=sharing
